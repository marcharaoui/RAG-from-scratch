Section 4: Code of Conduct  

At NovaTech Solutions, we are committed to maintaining a professional and inclusive workplace environment where all employees feel valued and respected. This section outlines the key principles of our Code of Conduct:

1. Professional Behavior:
   Employees must conduct themselves professionally at all times while representing NovaTech Solutions. This includes adhering to deadlines, maintaining clear communication, and respecting colleagues' time and efforts.

2. Confidentiality:
   Employees are required to protect sensitive company information, including client data, proprietary technology details, financial records, and internal communications. Sharing confidential information without authorization may result in disciplinary action or termination.

3. Anti-Harassment Policy:
   NovaTech Solutions has zero tolerance for harassment or discrimination based on race, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, or disability status. All complaints will be handled confidentially through HR channels.

4. Conflict of Interest:
   Employees must disclose any potential conflicts of interest that could impact their ability to perform job duties impartially (e.g., working for a competitor or having financial stakes in competing businesses).

5. Use of Company Resources:
   All company resources—including laptops, software licenses, and office supplies—must be used exclusively for business purposes unless explicitly authorized otherwise.

Confidential Notes (Internal Use Only):  
The updated Code of Conduct reflects recent changes in compliance regulations effective January 2025 (see HR memo #2025-03). Managers should conduct training sessions to ensure all team members understand these updates by April 30, 2025.
