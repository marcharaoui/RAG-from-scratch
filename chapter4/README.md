## Blog post
In this chapter, we go beyond traditional RAG by introducing agents that can think, reason, retrieve, and act on their own. 🤖⚙️
Here’s what you’ll learn:

 ✅ What makes an agent “agentic” (LLMs, tools, and orchestration)
 📐 Architectures: Single-agent vs Multi-agent systems
 🔄 Patterns like parallel, sequential, router, and more
 
If you want to learn about agentic systems or want to future-proof your AI workflows, this one's for you.
