## Blog post
In this chapter, we dive deeper into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), extending beyond text to handle multiple data types like images, audio, and video! 🎉
This chapter covers:

✅ Approaches to multimodal RAG: From simple text transformations to full multimodal embeddings <br>
📚 Indexing multimodal data for accurate retrieval <br>
🔍 Advanced retrieval techniques: Semantic search, late interaction, and late chunking <br>
✨ Building generative responses enriched by multimodal context <br>

This chapter is packed with practical insights to help you build powerful, context-aware multimodal AI tools!
